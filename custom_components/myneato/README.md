# Home Assistant Neato Integration

Home Assistant integration for Neato Vacuum Robots starting from D8 using the MyNeato App.

## Installation

Copy `myneato` folder to your `custom_components` folder, restart 
Home Assistant and add the integration as usual.

You need to provide your eMail address and password which you used 
in your MyNeato App.

## Disclaimer

This integration was only tested with a D10. Robots starting from 
D8 should work, but are completely untested. If you're willing to
help by debugging your D8 or D9 get in touch with me.
